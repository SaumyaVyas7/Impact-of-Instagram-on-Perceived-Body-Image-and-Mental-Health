RESEARCH QUESTION
How do Instagram influencers contribute to shaping body image perceptions among young adults, and what is the potential
impact on mental health?
BACKGROUND
The extensive influence of social media, particularly Instagram, in shaping societal beauty standards and influencing body
image perceptions among young adults is a growing concern. The influence of these online figures, particularly in fitness,
has reshaped body image perceptions, contributing to a noticeable decline in the overall sense of contentment. This prompts
a critical examination of the impact of fitness influencers on mental well-being. A study by Goldfield (2023) found that
“teens and young adults who reduced their social media use by 50% for just a few weeks saw significant improvement in
how they felt about both their weight and their overall appearance”. Jiotsa et al. (2021) found that "the widespread use of
social media in teenagers and young adults could increase body dissatisfaction as well as their drive for thinness, therefore
rendering them more vulnerable to eating disorders". Perloff (2014) emphasizes that "the interactive format and content
features of social media, such as the strong peer presence and exchange of a multitude of visual images, suggest that social
media, working via negative social comparisons, transportation, and peer normative processes, can significantly influence
body image concerns" This study aims to dive deeper into the specific role of Instagram influencers in shaping body image
perceptions among young adults and the potential impact on their mental health.
DATA
I will be constructing a dataset comprising over 200 Instagram posts from selected influencers in the fashion, beauty, and
fitness genres. Opting for manual data collection, I will focus on influencers based on criteria like follower count,
engagement rates, and content diversity. Post selection will adhere to specific criteria, including minimum likes for a
representative sample. The dataset will span six months, providing a comprehensive view of evolving trends and influencer
strategies within the chosen niches. This approach ensures a precise examination of both visual and textual elements in the
context of the rapidly changing social media landscape.
METHOD
In this study, I will adopt a content analysis approach to carefully analyse Instagram posts and user comments, aiming to
investigate into the elaborate relationships of influencer content and its impact on diverse groups' mental health. The process
will begin with an initial analysis of a subset of the dataset. The primary focus will be on questioning specific elements such
as content types, engagement metrics, and sentiments expressed in user comments. The comprehensive goal is to recognize
patterns and associations that shed light on the subtle relationship between influencer content, body image perceptions, and
various mental health outcomes across different demographic groups. By narrowing down on how these posts affect
individuals from distinct backgrounds, This study seeks to interpret diverse reactions to influencer content, providing a
comprehensive understanding of factors influencing mental health outcomes.
